# Neural Network Transfer

## Overview
Neural Network Transfer is a project designed to facilitate the transfer learning process in deep learning. This project enables users to leverage pre-trained neural networks for various machine learning tasks, significantly reducing training time and improving model accuracy.

## Features
- Supports multiple pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG, Inception, etc.)
- Customizable layers for fine-tuning
- Easy integration with PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Automatic dataset preprocessing
- Visualization tools for model performance analysis

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-transfer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd neural-network-transfer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Import the package:
   ```python
   from nn_transfer import TransferModel
   ```
2. Load a pre-trained model:
   ```python
   model = TransferModel(model_name='resnet50', num_classes=10)
   ```
3. Train the model with custom data:
   ```python
   model.train(train_loader, val_loader, epochs=10, lr=0.001)
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```python
   model.evaluate(test_loader)
   ```

## Supported Models
- ResNet (18, 34, 50, 101, 152)
- VGG (11, 13, 16, 19)
- InceptionV3
- MobileNetV2
- EfficientNet
